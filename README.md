# Algorithms

I've recently established the goal of getting a job at Google, and
I need to brush up on my algorithms in order to prepare for an interview! So, I am re-reading Introduction to Algorithms by C.L.R.S.,
which was the textbook for my CS38100 class on data structures and algorithms at Purdue. There's a lot to this book, and on top of
looking at the pseudo-code, I want to code it myself to better engrain it into my memory.

Wish me luck!
